# Booking Application for DayTheBarber!

![](https://i.imgur.com/rGJbOkD.png)

Hello, my name is Dayana Little. I am a barber who serves the DMV, Tristate, and surrounding areas. For years, I couldn't find a booking application that had all the features I needed to successfully service all of my clients, so I created one! With this app my clients can create a profile by simply signing in using Google Auth. From there you can book, edit, reschedule, view, and leave reviews for appointments.
